# Introduction

## Thanks!

First off, thank you for considering contributing.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Keep an open mind! Think of the edge cases and how your proposed changes may affect people who want to use the template.


## What's not helpful

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. We are not here to support your use case. Merely to provide a template, a starting point.

The application included with the template is absolutely available for your use. If you're an OP1 user too, definitely reach out and share some of your work. But we're not actively developing on it. Feel free to re-package and release as you see fit. If it's totally broken, do let us know.

## Ground Rules

* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per minor version. Major versions should be discussed thoroughly
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

## Your First Contribution
Help people who are new to your project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.

- Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.d

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github?pl=how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).


At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

**If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.**

## Getting started
* Just use the PR template and follow it through
* Run `make all` and ensure your tests pass locally

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix or adding a file.

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think others could benefit from it, open a PR
